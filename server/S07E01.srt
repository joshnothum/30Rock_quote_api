00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,925
You're losing her.
Go get her!

161
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,310
Go get your woman!

162
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:20,878
And speaking of which,

163
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:23,097
Angie's been
in the hospital for a week.

164
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:24,381
Could you go find out why?

165
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,101
- Ooh.
- Thank you.

166
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:31,689
Frank, you do stand-up.

167
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:33,774
How would you like
to have your own sitcom?

168
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:34,775
Can I have a hot wife?

169
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,360
- If you gain 50 pounds.
- Yeah.

170
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:37,945
Hey, I have an idea for a show.

171
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:40,081
It's about a boy
who befriends a talking panda,

172
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:41,532
and they're allowed
to sleep in the same bed.

173
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:42,666
Have it on my desk tomorrow.

174
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:46,504
Okay.
[Coughs]

175
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:51,259
Look, Jack,
I know you think fixing NBC

176
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:54,584
is just another negative
synergy dynamics matrix.

177
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:55,337
I wish.

178
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,006
Then I could just solve it
with a Schwarzfeld tesseract.

179
00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:01,268
No, this is the nadir
of my career, Lemon.

180
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:03,604
No room for advancement,
a boss who doesn't get it.

181
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:06,607
Every day, I wish some other
company had bought NBC.

182
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:08,716
Xerox, Alcoa, Paas.

183
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:09,750
The Easter Egg company?

184
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:11,163
They own their market.

185
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:12,460
When was the last time
you bought

186
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:14,423
a non-Paas egg-dyeing kit?

187
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:16,233
Try never.
Paas is the best.

188
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,235
Their wire egg dipper
is tops in the industry

189
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:20,287
with the thinnest egg loop
to reduce dye lines.

190
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:21,272
Exactly.

191
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,093
Only I don't work for Paas.
I work for Kabletown.

192
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:26,577
But I have a plan
that will fix everything.

193
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:28,129
Okay, here's the thing, Jack.

194
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:31,499
Your plan isn't gonna work.
Your shows are terrible.

195
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,793
I mean, have you seen
that new game show <i>Homonym?</i>

196
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:37,447
Your next word is "meat."

197
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:38,745
Oh, boy. Um...

198
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,590
Like when two people
run into each other.

199
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,045
Uh, sorry, it's the other one.

200
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,677
- Your next word is "stare."
- Okay.

201
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,072
Um, the things
you climb to get...

202
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:47,203
No, no, it's the other one.

203
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,998
It's always the other one.
Let me see the card.

204
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:50,806
No! Never!

205
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,542
- Your shows stink, Jack.
- Really?

206
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:53,804
So you don't peacock them?

207
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:55,660
I don't... think so.

208
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,324
But look, I get it.

209
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,610
The clock's ticking, and you
feel like time's running out.

210
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:01,245
It's like me and everything.

211
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,696
How long is this show
gonna last?

212
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,081
How many eggs do I have left?

213
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:06,316
Will I ever finish reading
<i>the corrections?</i>

214
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:08,619
But you can't let that panic
get into your head.

215
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:10,087
Well, thank you
for your feedback, Lemon,

216
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:12,373
but I'm not panicking,
I know exactly what I'm doing,

217
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:14,592
so good peacock to you.

218
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:19,296
- But, Jack...
- I said good peacock.

219
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,497
[Sighs]

220
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,184
Mr. Jordan.

221
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:25,186
I mentioned your
dinner party idea to Hazel.

222
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,637
Yes.

223
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:30,808
And I thought we'd have a little
<i>fete Chez nous ce soir.</i>

224
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:32,810
Oh, how nice to meet a woman
who speaks the language

225
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:35,529
of the Nazis'
most enthusiastic collaborators.

226
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:37,147
What a kind invitation.

227
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:39,400
I do enjoy seeing
the homes of poor whites.

228
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:40,451
What should I bring?

229
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:43,070
Just bring
your fascinating self.

230
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,354
Kenneth tells me
that you started

231
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:46,123
your own movie studio
this summer.

232
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:48,909
Yes. I'm sort of
the black Tyler Perry.

233
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,077
Oh, and I'm an aspiring actress

234
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:51,495
whose most recent
credits include

235
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,831
running onstage
during <i>Sister act.</i>

236
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,416
This is wonderful.

237
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,885
Tracy Jordan
is coming to dinner.

238
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,920
Just like in that episode
of <i>Family matters</i>

239
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,056
when Tracy Jordan
came to dinner.

240
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,808
You know I wasn't scripted
to be in that episode.

241
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:09,046
I just wandered onto set because
Reginald Veljohnson owed me $40.

242
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:10,814
Oh.
[Chuckles]

243
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:13,017
I'm thinking about Vegas
for the bachelorette party.

244
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:14,384
We can't stay at the Palms.

245
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:15,736
One of the Maloofs
wants me dead,

246
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,820
and the other one loves me.

247
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,072
I don't remember
which is which.

248
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:19,523
Okay, great.

249
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:20,824
Tracy, I need your advice.

250
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:21,942
You like to throw parties.

251
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:23,827
Why is everyone
asking me for advice?

252
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:25,529
I'm Tracy Jordan.

253
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:27,731
Father of 3, married 22 years.

254
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:29,833
I run my own business.

255
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:33,337
Oh, my God.
I'm the most stable adult here.

256
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,589
Oh, God, I don't want to be
Jenna's maid of honor.

257
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:37,240
She wants her
"something borrowed"

258
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,126
to be Jessica Biel's youth.

259
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:40,465
I don't know how to get that.

260
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,728
If you don't want to do this,
you should tank it.

261
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:44,625
That's what I do when
I want to get out of something

262
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,986
like a schedule,
a parent-teacher conference,

263
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,802
or this boring conversation.

264
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:49,855
Tank it?
Wow, no.

265
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,214
That's not "how I roll."

266
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,350
Thank you for saying that
in dated urban slang

267
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:54,831
so that I'll understand you.

268
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:55,606
Word.

269
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:58,649
And I would certainly never tank
on my friend Jenna.

270
00:09:58,667 --> 00:09:59,879
Because you're
terrified of her,

271
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,949
the way most white ladies are
with their best friends?

272
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:04,054
That is racist,
and only part true.

273
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:07,538
A good person doesn't
intentionally do a bad job.

274
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:08,818
I mean, look at Jack.

275
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:10,330
He's in this
terrible position at work,

276
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,575
he wishes he were
somewhere else.

277
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:12,671
Is he tanking it?

278
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:15,415
No. In fact,
he's trying even harder.

279
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:19,026
Tonight on NBC,
Joe Rogan is <i>Mandela.</i>

280
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:22,281
And if it's Wednesday, it must
be cricket night in America.

281
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:25,531
Then on Jay, a full hour
of Gary Sinise's band.

282
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:30,624
Oh, my God.
Jack's tanking NBC!

283
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:34,129
Turn your round.
God cop scene 24.

284
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,364
I know what you're doing, Jack.

285
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:37,393
You are purposely
tanking the network.

286
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,888
Good God, Lemon, what is it

287
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,756
with you liberals
and your conspiracy theories?

288
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:41,956
I've got bad news for you.

289
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:44,049
The CIA did not
invent crack cocaine,

290
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:46,235
the Levees blew themselves up
in New Orleans,

291
00:10:46,257 --> 00:10:48,961
and no one is trying
to destroy NBC.

292
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:51,102
Hang on, did you cast yourself
in this show?

293
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:51,945
What can I say?

294
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:53,970
We saw hundreds of actors
for God.

295
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:56,170
Finally, the network executive
said I should just play it.

296
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:57,505
You're the network executive.

297
00:10:57,537 --> 00:11:00,774
Uh, could we have a moment,
please?

298
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:04,741
Fine.
You got me.

299
00:11:04,762 --> 00:11:07,215
I'm steering the <i>Titanic</i>
into the iceberg.

300
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:08,597
Why?
Are you trying to get fired?

301
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,406
I'm trying to get Hank
to sell the network,

302
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,803
and the only way
to make him do that

303
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:14,022
is to turn it into
a money-losing embarrassment.

304
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:16,524
[Gasps]
This explains everything.

305
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:18,271
How long has this
been going on?

306
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:19,692
Seven years, eight?

307
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:20,855
Six weeks.

308
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:22,417
I have an investor lined up

309
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:24,680
who'll buy the network
and keep me in charge.

310
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,067
I can't tell you who it is,

311
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:27,285
but his word is as good

312
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,370
as the color consistency
on one of his Easter Eggs.

313
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:31,055
Adolph Paas?

314
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:32,271
This is wrong, Jack.

315
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:35,652
Lemon, I cannot go to another
business school reunion

316
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:38,913
and sit at the non-CEO table
with the...

317
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:40,822
Women and nice men.

318
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:42,872
You're right, Lemon, the clock
is ticking for both of us,

319
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:45,565
but if I pull this off,
it's good for you too.

320
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:48,827
You've never worked at a
properly-managed company before.

321
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,480
That's true.

322
00:11:49,517 --> 00:11:51,630
Before this, I ran
an all-women's theater company.

323
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,640
- Everyone was vice-president.
- Think of the job stability.

324
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,511
Less stress, a commissary
that has taco Tuesdays again.

325
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,128
After seven years,
you'll finally have a life.

326
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,428
And what if your plan
doesn't work?

327
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:03,770
Of course, it's a risk,

328
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,523
but sometimes your only choice
is to blow everything up

329
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:09,605
and build something better
out of the rubble.

330
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:11,787
Look at Sherman's
march to the sea.

331
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:14,532
Or what my good friend bane
tried to do to Gotham.

332
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,616
Join me, Lemon.

333
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,085
Help me tank NBC.

334
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:20,888
Never. You're playing
with peoples' lives here.

335
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,286
Who do you think you are?

336
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:24,699
God, we're ready for you.

337
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,266
If there is one thing
I have realized from being God,

338
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:33,851
it's that the more you know,

339
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,471
the more you realize
you do not...

340
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:37,318
Know.

341
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:38,918
Why is he learning anything?

342
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:40,777
He's supposed to be God.
[Knock on door]

343
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,118
[Gasps, turns off TV]

344
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:46,116
Now, don't embarrass me.

345
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,911
Tracy!
Welcome to our home.

346
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:53,776
Well, it's not
technically a home,

347
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:55,856
because no one's
supposed to be living here,

348
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:59,327
but welcome to our condemned
site of the Candyman murders.

349
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,380
Will you put this in the oven
at about 200 degrees?

350
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,048
My snake should be
very comfortable

351
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,366
while she gives birth.

352
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,635
Oh.

353
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:12,056
Mr. Jordan, please help
yourself to some appetizers.

354
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:17,011
Thank you.
Your home is terrible.

355
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:18,851
Shall we conversation?

356
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,301
- Yes. We're having weather.
- Much weather.

357
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:23,720
So speaking
of your movie studio...

358
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:26,053
This conversation
has a real flow to it.

359
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,523
Do you ever have
any roles for white women

360
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,925
who've been described
by the <i>Hollywood reporter</i>

361
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,762
as "some lady" who ruined
the premiere of <i>Paranorman?</i>

362
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,431
Oh, I always have one white
person in all of my movies.

363
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,699
We have to have a villain.

364
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,535
Oh, and who's worse
than us whites, right?

365
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,038
I mean, look at slavery.
That was bananas.

366
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,873
[Laughter]
[Clattering]

367
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,276
Oh, that sturgeon
just will not die.

368
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:52,019
Excuse me a moment.

369
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:54,081
Oh, I also do accents.

370
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:57,418
[Asian accent]
Oh, me a cockney person.

371
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:59,921
This is your Uncle Bob?

372
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:03,123
[Laughs]

373
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,645
Oh, Liz.
F.Y.I.

374
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,730
Paul's family dog
is gonna be the ring bearer.

375
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:13,028
Zoltan is an 18-year-old
German Shepherd who cannot walk.

376
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:14,454
So you're gonna be
in charge of him.

377
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,098
No, Jenna,
I'm allergic to dogs.

378
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:16,906
Oh, don't worry.

379
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:19,577
He's hairless because
of his insanity medication.

380
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,572
Also, since this is
a surprise wedding,

381
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:23,797
you're gonna want
to carry around

382
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,357
your bridesmaid's dress
with you at all times.

383
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,396
Look how great this is
gonna look next to me.

384
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,382
You know I can't
wear green, Jenna.

385
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,732
The clinique lady says
I have witch undertones.

386
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,613
Liz, this isn't about you.

387
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:36,837
Now, tonight, we have
a tasting with the caterer.

388
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,139
It's gonna be
molecular gastronomy.

389
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,264
The cake is a tasteless foam.

390
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:42,463
[Deep voice]
There's no cake?

391
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:43,795
Tonight on NBC...

392
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:44,739
<i>Tank it,</i>

393
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:46,453
the reality event of the year

394
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,322
where we make grandpas
put on tank tops

395
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,106
and then laugh at them.

396
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:51,556
<i>Tank it.</i>

397
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,626
You know what?
I can't do anything tonight.

398
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:59,124
Because tonight is your surprise
bachelorette party! Aah!

399
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,752
Aah! No way!
You planned it already?

400
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:04,741
Sure. And you should
get your hopes way up.

401
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,144
See you at my apartment
at 8:00.

402
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:08,072
Your apartment?
Why?

403
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:10,190
It's a surprise.

404
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,743
And there's nothing worse
than a surprise Lemon party.

405
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:16,422
Kenneth, darling,

406
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:18,570
why don't you run out
and get dessert?

407
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:21,545
Oh, but we have
government ice cream.

408
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:24,081
And that's what you're
gonna serve to Tracy Jordan?

409
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,016
I'm as shocked as anybody.

410
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,382
Oh, uh, okay.

411
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:29,887
Oh, maybe the nice
vending machine

412
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:32,473
at the prison is working again.

413
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,141
You're a real man,
Tracy Jordan,

414
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,639
playing it cool all night

415
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,284
while I rubbed your foot
under the table.

416
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,866
My foot?

417
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,951
No.
That's shoe stuffing.

418
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,320
It helps keep
the shape of my shoes.

419
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:49,073
Why was you
rubbing my foot anyway?

420
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:53,566
Please.

421
00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:55,541
You know what's happening here.

422
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,900
I never know
what's happening anywhere.

423
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,598
[Giggling]

424
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,920
Okay, let's get
this party started!

425
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:06,807
Ooh, I smell Italian guys.

426
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:09,593
What is this?

427
00:16:09,627 --> 00:16:10,961
It's your bachelorette party.

428
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:13,679
Bethany from work is here,
and a bunch of my neighbors,

429
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,535
a clown.

430
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:17,134
And there's
a <i>God cop</i> marathon on NBC.

431
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:18,815
I think Esposito lied to us.

432
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:21,117
What do you mean "you think"?
You're God!

433
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:23,028
I don't understand
the rules of this.

434
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:25,045
Let us pray.

435
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:26,278
To whom?

436
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:27,361
Before you say anything,

437
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:29,363
I have one more
surprise for you.

438
00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:32,432
Officer, we're ready!

439
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:35,205
Oh, thank God.

440
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:38,122
Listen up, ladies.
You're all in a lot of trouble

441
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,960
if you don't protect yourselves
against identity theft.

442
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:43,160
Please take a pamphlet,
pass them along.

443
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:45,428
Okay, you're upset.

444
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:46,415
But this is what you get

445
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:49,465
when you choose Liz Lemon
as your maid of honor.

446
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,537
Oh, so let's
get this over with.

447
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,775
I mean, what's the worst
you could possibly...

448
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:56,495
- Aah!
- [Screams]

449
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,861
Tracy, I will do anything

450
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:02,049
to play a villain
in one of your movies.

451
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:03,798
The camera loves me.

452
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:06,652
Especially
when I flash my baby blues.

453
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:08,406
Why are they blue?

454
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:09,962
- Yeah.
- No.

455
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,662
I'm married, Hazel.

456
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:12,853
So am I.

457
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:15,613
And if he ever wakes up
from that coma, I'm dead!

458
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:17,329
That's why I live for today.

459
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:20,749
You're just using Kenneth,
and I'm telling him everything!

460
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:23,379
Whatever.
Go ahead and try.

461
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:25,144
I'm gonna have to try?

462
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,472
Worst night ever!

463
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,480
[Crash]

464
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:31,261
Just ask one of your famous
friends to be maid of honor!

465
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:33,421
Why do you think I asked you
in the first place?

466
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,676
Because you're not famous!

467
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,514
You think I want
someone up there with me

468
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:38,949
that other people
are looking at?

469
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:40,467
I wanted you
because you're nothing!

470
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:41,506
[Glass breaks]
[Screams]

471
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:42,381
Yeah, I get it.

472
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,150
You didn't want
to get Pippa Middleton.

473
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:46,646
Why would you even mention her?

474
00:17:46,724 --> 00:17:48,859
[Crash]

475
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:52,374
Who's gonna be
my maid of honor now, Liz?

476
00:17:52,414 --> 00:17:53,447
Nobody.

477
00:17:54,304 --> 00:17:56,304
From the rubble, I will build.

478
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,470
Are you talking about me
underneath your breath?

479
00:17:58,513 --> 00:17:59,847
Jenna, that's it.

480
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:01,705
Nobody will be
your maid of honor

481
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:03,866
because there's only
one person who can be.

482
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:04,666
You.

483
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,168
- What? That's crazy.
- Think about it.

484
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:09,047
There would be nobody
to steal your spotlight.

485
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,633
In fact, you would
have two spotlights.

486
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:16,528
I think the maid of honor
should sing at my wedding.

487
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:17,184
Sure.

488
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:19,340
And she could do a fashion
show that takes the audience

489
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:20,924
all the way through
the wedding night.

490
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,115
And what if she came in
in a wheelchair,

491
00:18:23,146 --> 00:18:27,015
and then stood up, and everyone
applauded and cried?

492
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:29,900
I know you doubted me, but now
you see my plan could work.

493
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:32,365
So what do you say?

494
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:33,987
Are you on board, Liz?

495
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:35,470
You just called me Liz!

496
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,978
Oh, we can fix that
in the cutting room.

497
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:38,506
Uh, Jonathan...

498
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,575
Where's my car?

499
00:18:45,695 --> 00:18:49,002
Kenneth, I have something
I need to tell you.

500
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,890
Last night when you left,
Hazel came on to me

501
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,002
'cause she wants me
to put her in a movie.

502
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:56,921
Hazel, is this true?

503
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:59,251
Yeah, it is true.

504
00:18:59,397 --> 00:19:00,464
Not!

505
00:19:00,482 --> 00:19:01,390
What I said was

506
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:04,215
I would never sleep with Tracy
for a part in a movie.

507
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:07,129
Oh, please, you would love for
me to fall asleep on top of you.

508
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:09,169
Come on,
Kenmore washers and dryers,

509
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:10,992
who you gonna believe here?

510
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:13,088
- My best friend.
- Not really.

511
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:15,049
- And my girlfriend.
- You wish.

512
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:17,626
Well, I always
believe you, sir,

513
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,151
because you're on television.

514
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:20,245
And webisodes.

515
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:23,432
But yesterday you told me
our women are queens,

516
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:24,784
and they're always right,

517
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,931
which means I should
believe Hazel.

518
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:30,669
But that would make you wrong,
Mr. Jordan.

519
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:32,963
And you've never been wrong
about anything before.

520
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,808
It's a blessing and a purse.

521
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:38,225
You can't both be right.

522
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:44,939
Unless Hazel is always right.

523
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:48,145
But only because you said so,
Mr. Jordan,

524
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:51,126
which means you're right too.

525
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:55,034
And both sides being right
is like kissing your sister.

526
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:57,986
A wonderful treat!

527
00:19:58,088 --> 00:19:59,522
[Laughs]

528
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,125
Bad move, Jordan.

529
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,360
We'll see who's still
working here in six months.

530
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:05,913
My hearing is bad
because of firecrackers,

531
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:08,916
but we'll see who's still
working here in six months.

532
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:11,368
- That's what I just said.
- What?

533
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:12,753
Okay, I get it.

534
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:14,538
Sometimes tanking it
is the only option.

535
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:15,973
What did you do?

536
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,476
Fake a sprained ankle to get
out of that breast health 5k?

537
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,710
No, I did that.

538
00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:22,379
I forgot my sports bra,
so ironically...

539
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:23,680
Uh, it doesn't matter, Lemon.

540
00:20:23,714 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm just glad
that you've seen the light.

541
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:30,854
Now, help me tank NBC,
and you'll be helping yourself.

542
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:32,106
You'll have it all.

543
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:34,274
Jack, it's 9:30
in the morning.

544
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:36,860
We're not trying to do
a good job here, Lemon.

545
00:20:36,894 --> 00:20:37,995
Now, what do you say?

546
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:41,565
Are you in?

547
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,500
Let's take this mother down.

548
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,209
- Next word, "sent."
- I don't care.

549
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:53,266
Okay, "cent" like a penny.
Whatever.

550
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:55,154
No! Sorry, no.

551
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:57,824
Oh, it's a homonym double down.

552
00:20:57,848 --> 00:20:59,110
Means you get to guess again.

553
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:00,695
- "Sent."
- Okay, um...

554
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:04,025
Then "scent"
like a smell or an odor.

555
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:05,487
No. It's the third one.

556
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:06,668
[Bleep] Yourself!

557
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,550
Next word is "au pere."

558
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,355
What? There is only
one definition.

559
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:12,007
It's like a nanny,
a foreign nanny.

560
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,292
No! You forgot.

561
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,161
It could also be an exclamation
about a fruit,

562
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,605
as in, "oh, pear!"

563
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:18,526
What you are doing here
is not right!

564
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:21,328
I'm... I'm leaving.
[Laughs]
